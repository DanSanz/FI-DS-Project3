### Final Project Summary
for this project we investigated the NBA statistics Dataset which we found online. we applied statistical anaylsis on it in order to investigate 3 Hypothesis. we applied our previous knowledge of cleaning and EDA on the Dataset and looked at our Dataset and made our Hypothesis based on the Dataset.

#### Hypotheis 1
* H0 Null hypothesis: there is a significant difference in player performance when playing Home vs Away
* H1 Alternate hypothesis: there is no significant difference in player performance when playing Home vs Away

#### Hypotheis 2
* H0 Null hypothesis: it is significantly easier for teams to make the Playoffs in the East Vs the West from the last 16 Seasons 
* H1 Alternate hypothesis: there is no significant difference in ease for teams to make the Playoffs in the East Vs the West from the last 16 Seasons 

#### Hypotheis 3
* H0 Null hypothesis: There is a significant difference in teams winning who have at least one or more players who are all stars(with a DF_SCORE > 40 in their team)
* H1 Alternate hypothesis: There is no significant difference in teams winning who have at least one or more players who are all stars(with a DF_SCORE > 40 in their team)

**_Findings_**

* Your notebook should clearly show how you arrived at your results for each hypothesis test, including how you calculated your p-values.   
<br>
* You should also include any other statistics that you find relevant to your analysis, such as effect size.

### Blog Post Must-Haves

### Executive Summary Must-Haves

Your presentation should:

* Contain between 5-10 professional quality slides detailing:
<br>  
    * A high-level overview of your methodology  
    <br>  
    * The results of your hypothesis tests  
    <br>  
    * Any real-world recommendations you would like to make based on your findings (ask yourself--why should the executive team care about what you found? How can your findings help the company?)  
    <br>  
* Take no more than 5 minutes to present  
<br>  
* Avoid technical jargon and explain results in a clear, actionable way for non-technical audiences.
